# random-team-generator

This was React project built using HTML,CSS and Javascrip.  Many of my projects were built to practice the skills I have learnt. However, this  random team generator was built 
because I thought it would be something I would use in my life. You can add names to a list and generate random names (one by one), you can split the names into pairs or even halves.

This is one of the projects I am most proud of and you can access the app here (https://johnnyji123.github.io/random-team-generator/).
